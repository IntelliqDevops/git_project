`Version`   | The version of the policy language. AWS recommends always using `"2012-10-17"`.                                                                                                                    
`Statement` | A list of permissions being granted.                                                                                                                                                                 `Effect`    | `"Allow"` means the action is permitted. (Could also be `"Deny"` in other contexts.)                                                                                                               |
| `Principal` | `"*"` means the permission is granted to **everyone** â€” no authentication needed.                                                                                                                   |
| `Action`    | `"s3:GetObject"` allows **read access to individual objects** (like HTML, CSS, etc.).                                                                                                               |
| `Resource`  | `"${aws_s3_bucket.static_site.arn}/*"` specifies **all objects** in this bucket. <br> It uses Terraform's interpolation to refer to the bucket's ARN and appends `/*` to match all items inside it. |

ARN stands for resource name
If bucket name is 
my-static-website-123456
then arn will be
arn:aws:s3:::my-static-website-123456

arn:aws:s3:::my-static-website-123456
